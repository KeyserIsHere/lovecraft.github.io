# LÃ¶vecraft

A minecraft clone built in love 11.2 for fun using my custom 3d engine and [cpml](https://github.com/excessive/cpml).

*WARNING: This code is old and bad! Don't look at it!*

If you want to make a voxel engine or something like this, I would recommend checking out my 3d library [g3d](https://github.com/groverburger/g3d), reading up about how to use [LuaJIT's ffi](https://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html) and love's new [bytedata object](https://love2d.org/wiki/ByteData) for storing voxel chunk data as byte arrays instead of strings, and using [love's multithreading options](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.thread) so generating chunks won't halt gameplay.
